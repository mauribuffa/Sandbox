# Database (Drizzle + Neon)

This project is in active development. There is **no production data and no need for backwards compatibility**, so we do not keep a migration history.

**Never run `drizzle-kit migrate` or `drizzle-kit generate`.** Do not create migration files, and do not add a `db:migrate` or `db:generate` script.

Apply schema changes by editing `lib/db/schema.ts` and running:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

`db:push` diffs the schema against the database and applies the change directly. If a change is destructive, Drizzle Kit will prompt — accept it and move on; losing dev data is fine.

When a change replaces a table outright (drop one, add another), `db:push` cannot tell a new table from a rename and stops on an interactive prompt that needs a TTY. Drop the obsolete table first, then push — that removes the ambiguity and push runs unattended.

Schema changes run over the direct/unpooled connection (`DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`), already configured in `drizzle.config.ts`.
